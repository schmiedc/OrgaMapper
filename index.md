# Introduction

The aim of the OrgaMapper workflow is to measure and map organelle distribution within cells with ease.
The distance of the organelles are related to the nucleus using location or signal intensity.

## How to cite

## Accepted datasets

Single multichannel .tiff files and multichannel multiseries files. We tested the workflow on multiseries .nd2 files from Nikon CSU.

For the Data analysis and plotting to work seamlessly with the image analysis we require the following naming pattern.
Single .tif files:
\<Name\>\_\<Treatment\>\_\<Number\>

Multiseries files:
\<Name\>\_\<Treatment\/Wellnumber\>

The data is expected to contain a channel with nucleus staining (DAPI) staining against cytoplasm (CMFA) and against an organelle of choice.
